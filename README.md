#### 1. Business space
Our team is choosing to focus on building a cruise ship database. This is an
important travel method that millions of people may choose when they are on a
vacation. Before the pandemic, there are profits generated 3.37 billion USD each
year for an estimation. In 2019, the global cruise industry welcomed 29.7 million
passengers, creating jobs for 1.8 million people around the world. Organizing data
for a cruise line company is crucial in their service of providing better experiences for
their customers.


#### 2. Typical users
The database is designed for those who need to understand the connection lies
within a cruise ship trip. Typical users for this database will be cruise ship
management companies and trip agencies. Since the database can track the
customer information, they can study and analyze customer booking information.
Also, employees such as crew members can track the facilities on the ship for future
improvements and maintenance. Furthermore, passengers can use the database to
look up cruise lines and ship facilities that they are interested in.


#### 3. Decisions your users will make based on the data in the database
The users will be able to analyze the data to provide better cruise routes and
entertainment for consumer experiences and profitability. Our user will also be able
to keep track of important data in regards to all cruise lines and make changes and
maintenance requests for ships if needed.


#### 4. Anticipated volume of transactions
Approximately 10 million transactions each year, with a floor of 5.8 million
transactions and ceiling of 30 million transactions. This is estimated according to the
data that the number of ocean cruise passengers worldwide reached approximately
5.8 million, dropping from a record high of nearly 30 million passengers in 2019.
